## The science behind sound, & making your own instruments!


To begin our unit on music, we started out talking about what sound is.  Students learned that sound is vibrations traveling through the air as sound waves, and that sound is a form of energy like light and heat.  They learned what volume and pitch meant, and discussed echoes and how animals such as bats and dolphin use echolocation.

Here are a couple of links with more information: [basics of sound](http://documentation.apple.com/en/soundtrackpro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=B%26section=1%26tasks=true) and [a cool brainpop video](http://www.brainpop.com/science/energy/sound/preview.weml).  We were really impressed by how much the students already knew and we had a very lively discussion going on about why animals use echolocation.

After the discussion, students created their own instruments using materials such as beads, rubber bands, paper, pie tins, etc. with the goal of creating five different sounds with one instrument.  In the pictures below,  Ananicole demonstrates how her instrument works and Danielle shows off her project!

## Our basic lesson plan is below:




#### Introduction:


Students will learn about the science behind sound, and build an instrument that can make at least 5 different types of sounds.

<!-- more -->Materials:



	
  * aluminum pie tins

	
  * plastic beads

	
  * small plastic cups

	
  * tape

	
  * construction paper

	
  * plastic straws

	
  * aluminum foil

	
  * rubber bands




_Note: all of these materials are optional, you can use anything you have on hand! Just make sure that the materials will allow students to produce a wide variety of sounds_




#### Preparation Time:


Approximately 10 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Set out project materials at front of room.


#### Project Time:


40-50 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


Students worked in groups of 2-3, and were allowed to pick from the materials provided using a lottery system.  Each group drew a number 1-10 from a bag, and they were required to choose 2 materials every time their number was called.  The groups took turns until most of the supplies were gone.

After students made their instruments, they came up to the front of the class to demonstrate the 5 different types of sounds they could create!
