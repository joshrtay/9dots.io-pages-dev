## Introduction to Currents, Conductivity, and Circuits




#### Introduction:


This project gives an introduction to electricity, explaining basic concepts of electric currents, conductivity, and circuits. Students will then explore these concepts playing with conductive play dough.


#### Objectives:


Students will begin to understand the basic electricity concepts.


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * [Squishy Circuits](http://squishycircuitsstore.com/kits.html)




#### Handouts and Other Media:




#### Preparation Time:


Approximately 10 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Gather all materials to make the squishy circuits dough.


#### Project Time:


1 hour 15 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. What electricity? [5 minutes]_

Begin by discussing with students what they know about electricity.  Where does it come from? What do they use it for?

2. _What are electric currents? _What kinds of materials carry electric currents? _[10 minutes]_

Explain that an electric current means the flow of electric charge through some material.  Discuss why electricity flows through certain materials with students.  Why do we use metal wires and not wood ones?  Start with explaining that all materials are made of tiny atoms.  All atoms have charges on them (either electrons or ions).  In materials that carry electricity, such as metals, the atom's charges are loosely held onto, and can travel from one atom to another.

_3. What is an electric circuit?  [5 minutes]_

Discuss the concepts of circuits to students.  Explain that in order for the electrical current to flow, it must form a closed path, or a circuit where the electrons can connect back to the source of the electric current.

_4. Make Squishy Circuit Dough [20 minutes]_

We had the students make the dough for the squishy circuits in class and they definitely enjoyed the process.  Note: This year, we did not make the insulating dough, only the conductive dough.  We simple used air gaps as the insulation in our squishy circuits.  If you have the desire, though, the insulating dough is fun to have as well.

_5. Play with Squishy Circuits [35 minutes][![](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/Photo-Jan-29-5-17-43-PM-300x225.jpg)](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/Photo-Jan-29-5-17-43-PM.jpg)_

Once the students made their dough, we had them figure out how to light a light bulb with their dough and their battery.  If students finish this quickly, challenge them to make light bulbs like in parallel and in series.  Give the students time to play around with the concepts of circuits.


#### Discussion Questions:


1. How do you make a light bulb turn on with your Squishy Circuit kit?

2. Does the light bulb light if you do not complete the circuit back the the battery?

## Makey Makey Circuit Challenges







#### Introduction:


Students will continue to explore circuits, using the Makey Makey and different conductive materials.


#### Objectives:


Students will get hands on experience thinking about electricity and use their creativity to make a variety circuits with the Makey Makey.


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * [Makey Makey Kits](http://www.makeymakey.com/)

	
  * [Squishy Circuit Kits](http://squishycircuitsstore.com/kits.html)

	
  * Conductive Materials (play dough, chewy candy, lemons, metals, bananas, etc)





#### Handouts and Other Media:


[Electricity Challenges](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/Electricity-Challenge.docx)


#### Preparation Time:


5 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Print handouts for teams.


#### Project Time:


1 hour 30 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. Review: What are electric currents, conductivity, and circuits? [10 minutes]_

Review the concepts of electric currents, conductivity, and circuits learned in the prior lesson. Be sure to spend time on circuits, and the fact that in order for circuits to work, they must connect back to the source of the current.

_2.  Introduction to Makey Makey [10 minutes]_

![](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/Photo-Jan-29-5-45-53-PM-300x225.jpg)Give the students a brief intro to the Makey Makey.  Explain how the electrical current leaves the computer through the USB cord, through the wires, through their bodies, and back through the wires to the ground in order to complete a circuit.  When the circuit is complete, the Makey Makey makes the corresponding button on the compter work.  This brief intro should be enough for the students to work through the challenges.

3. _Makey Makey Challenges? [1 hour 10 minutes]_

Have students work through the Electricity Challenges.  As students work with the Makey Makey, make sure to explain to them how their circuits are being completed. We gave the team with the most points a prize at the end of the day!
