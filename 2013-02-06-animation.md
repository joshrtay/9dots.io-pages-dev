## History of Animation and Flipbooks




#### Introduction:


This project gives an overview of the history of animation as well as an explanation of why animation works for the human eye, with a fun flipbook project at the end.


#### Objectives:


Students will begin to understand the mechanics of the current day animation they see on television.


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Paper

	
  * Markers




#### Handouts and Other Media:


[History of Animation Video](http://video.mit.edu/watch/history-of-animation-3391/)

[The Pixar Story Intro (Part 1)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oggMSPCHNtw)

[The Pixar Story Intro (Part 2)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiDRDZ4w0l8)


#### Preparation Time:


Approximately 10 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Cut paper into  ~ 3.5in x 4.25in pieces


#### Project Time:


1 hour 15 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


Begin by showing the History of Animation video and the intro to The Pixar Story.  Then discuss the following with the students:

_1. What is animation? [5 minutes]_

Begin by asking students what animation means.  Explain that to "animate" means to bring something to life.

2. _What is the history of animation? [15 minutes]_

Talk about how animation started even before televisions or projectors were invented.  People have been using simple machines like [zoetropes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoetrope) and flipbooks to make drawings come to life for thousands of years.

_3. Why do animated drawings seem like they are moving? [10 minutes]_

The students should know this one from the History of Animation video, so test them out!  Talk about how animations like flipbooks work for humans because our eyes remember the previous picture for about 1/32 second after it is shown.

![](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/2013-01-07-17.21.51-225x300.jpg)

We can test out this concept of an _afterimage_ using [this picture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Afterimagenpov.svg).  Have the students stare a the picture for about 30 seconds, and then look away to a blank white space.  Their eyes should still "remember" the picture and see it (maybe in inverse colors) in the white space.

_4. Flipbooks [45 minutes]_

Give the students little sheets of paper to test out their hands at animation by making a flipbook. In order for the flipbook to turn out the best, student should trace the previous picture with slight differences to make their animations.


#### Discussion Questions:


1. Why do the static pictures in the flipbooks appear to be moving?

## Introduction to Stop Motion Animation







#### Introduction:


Students will learn about how stop motion animation works, and try out their own stop motion challenges.


#### Objectives:


Students will understand more about the evolution of animation, learning to use their computers and video editing to make a stop motion animation.


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Play dough

	
  * Computer with iMovie





#### Handouts and Other Media:


[Stop Motion Challenges](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/stop-motion-day-1.docx)

[Deadline Stop Motion Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpWM0FNPZSs)

[Summer Nights Stop Motion Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whyjdt5Qso)

[In Your Arms Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOu0DuxFAT0)

[Making of In Your Arms Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIH4MJAC2Tg&feature=youtu.be)

[T-Shirt War Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKWdSCt4jGE)

[Wallace and Gromit Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDhmlMQT60)


#### Preparation Time:


5 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Print handouts for teams.


#### Project Time:


1 hour 30 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. What is animation? [5 minutes]_

Begin by reviewing what animation means.  Explain that to "animate" means to bring something to life.

2. _What is stop motion animation? [5 minutes]_

Explain how a stop motion video is very similar to a flipbook, but now using pictures of objects that when played quickly look like the objects are moving.

_3. Example Videos [20 minutes]_

Show the students the examples of different stop motions (links [here](http://9-dots.org/animation#videos)).

_4. Make Videos [1 hour]_

Have students get the hang of making a stop motion by working through the [stop motion handout challenges.](http://9-dots.org/animation#videos)

At 9 Dots, we use the cameras on our mac book air laptops to take a series of pictures.  (Students should be sure to not move their computer after they begin taking pictures or the movie will not turn out well.)  Once the pictures are complete, we import them into iMovie and play them each for about .1sec.  Make sure to change the cropping to "Fit" or the movie won't look so awesome.

## Story-Boarding and Stop Motion Animation - Day 1




#### Introduction:


Students will continue learning about how stop motion animation works, starting to plan out their own video using a story-board.


#### Objectives:


Students will learn more about movie editing software, the story-boarding process, and the various elements that need to be planned in a video (such as sounds, words, images, camera angle).


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Toys, play dough, legos (whatever students want to be the subject of their movies)

	
  * Computer with iMovie




#### Handouts and Other Media:


[Story-Boarding Handout](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/STORY-BOARDING-HANDOUT.docx)

[Toy Story Story-Boarding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOeaC8kcxH0)

[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUIlKbZKha0)


#### Preparation Time:


Approximately 5 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Print handout.


#### Project Time:


1 hour 30 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. What different parts are there to videos? [10 minutes]_

Write the following terms on the board:



	
  * images

	
  * sounds

	
  * words

	
  * close-up shot

	
  * wide shot




Discuss with the students what these terms mean in context of movies.  Show the students the [clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUIlKbZKha0) of Willy Wonka.  Stop the video occasionally when it uses the above terms to help the viewer understand the plot.





![](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/Photo-Jan-16-4-53-08-PM-e1360185463597-224x300.jpg)2. _How do people plan out all of the elements of their video? [10 minutes]_

There is a lot to plan when making a movie!  As the students have discovered, the movie maker needs to coordinate a lot of different elements to make the movie work well for the viewer.  Explain that movie makers use "story-boards" to plan out the different elements of movies.  Show the [clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOeaC8kcxH0) of Toy Story story-boarding to explain the concept of story-boarding a little more to the students.

_3. Write your story-board [1 hour 10 minutes]_

Have students use the story-boarding handout to plan out their own stop-motion animation video.  (Try to dissuade the students from getting too fancy with the plot - stop motions are hard to make!!)
