#### Unit Overview:


Students will learn about various aspects of cars, from gear ratios to fuel types.  Students will begin to understand how cars work and flex their creative design muscles.



#### Grade Level:


4-8


#### Projects:


[Lego Car Race](http://9-dots.org/drive-my-car#lego_car) - Teach gear ratios that achieve maximum speed as well as general car features including gears, axles, and wheels.

[Puff-Mobiles](http://9-dots.org/drive-my-car#puff) - Students will learn about alternatives fuels and then build a “puff-mobile” that runs on the power of students lungs!

[Slowest Car Race](http://9-dots.org/drive-my-car#slow) - Students will continue learning about gear ratios by trying to design the slowest car.

## Lego Car Race




#### Introduction:


Project #1 provides an introduction to cars with a fun lego car race.


#### Objectives:


During Project #1, students will learn about gear ratios and will design a lego car with gears to race against their classmates.


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Gears (ie those found [here](http://www.delta-education.com/productdetail.aspx?Collection=Y&prodID=1049))

	
  * Lego technic sets




#### Handouts and Other Media:


[Lego Technic Parts Handout](http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Lego_Technic_Parts_List.pdf) to teach students the names of different Lego Technic parts such as gears, axles, and bushings – students should draw a picture of each part in the corresponding box.


#### Preparation Time:


Approximately 5 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Distribute gears and lego technic sets to teams.  Draw example “fast” and “slow” gear ratios on the board.


#### Project Time:


1 hour 20 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. What are gears? [5 minutes]_

Begin by discussing with students what they think gears are.  A gear is a simple machine that can change the speed, torque, and direction of a force.  Brainstorm where students have seen gears in every day life, including:



	
  * bicycles

	
  * cars

	
  * watches


2. _How do gear ratios work? [15 minutes]_

Pass out an educational gear set to each group of students.  Allow the students to play a game where each student adds a gear to the set until all of the gears are used up.  Show how all of the gears are able to move with only one handle

Next, put two equally sized gears next to each other, one with a handle and one with a pointer.  Have one student turn the handle 1x around while the other students count how many times the pointer goes around.  Next, put a small gear with a pointer next to the big gear with the handle.  Have the students repeat the exercise, noticing that when the small gear is on the machine, it turns more times with one turn of the handle.

Explain to students that by using gear ratios with their cars, they will be able to make their lego car move faster than the motor alone.

_3. Build a lego car [50 minutes]_

Allow students to build their lego cars.

_4. Race your car! [10 minutes]_

Allow students to race their classmates’ lego cars.


#### Discussion Questions:


1. Why did the winning car go the fastest?

2. How did gear ratios affect the speed of the car?

## Puff-Mobiles







#### Introduction:


Students learn about different ways to fuel vehicles.


#### Objectives:


Students will learn about alternatives fuels and then build a “puff-mobile” that runs on the power of students lungs!


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Straws – 4 per team

	
  * Mint lifesavers

	
  * Index cards – 2 per team

	
  * Paper lunch sack – 1 per team

	
  * Masking tape




#### Handouts and Other Media:




#### Preparation Time:


5 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Sort supplies into paper lunch sacks for each team.


#### Project Time:


1 hour 20 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. What is energy? [5 minutes]_

Discuss with students what they think “energy” is.  Energy is the ability to do work.

2. _Review various types of fuels [25 minutes]_

Distribute information on different types of fuels to the students.  Review information about gasoline, ethanol, compressed natural gas, electricity, and biodiesel.  Kid-friendly information can be found online [here](http://www.eia.gov/kids/).  After students have reviewed their information, have them present to the class information about the fuel including:



	
  1. Where does it come from?

	
  2.  Is it renewable?

	
  3. Fun fact.


_3. Project Design and Race [45 minutes]_

The goal of the project is to build a vehicle that moves the furthest with 3 blows.

_4. Discussion Questions [5 minutes]_

1.  Are the puff-mobiles fuel renewable?

2. Why did the winning car win?

## Slowest Car Race




#### Introduction:


Students will re-visit gear ratios with a slow car race.


#### Objectives:


Students will continue learning about gear ratios by trying to design the slowest car.


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Gears (ie those found [here](http://www.delta-education.com/productdetail.aspx?Collection=Y&prodID=1049))

	
  * Lego technic sets




#### Handouts and Other Media:




#### Preparation Time:


Approximately 5 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:

#### Project Time:


1 hour 20 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:

2. _How do gear ratios work? [15 minutes]_

Pass out an educational gear set to each group of students.  Put two equally sized gears next to each other, one with a handle and one with a pointer.  Have one student turn the handle 1x around while the other students count how many times the pointer goes around.  Next, put a small gear with a handle next to the big gear with the pointer.  Have the students repeat the exercise, noticing that the large gear turns fewer times with one turn of the handle.

Explain to students that by using gear ratios with their cars, they will be able to make their lego car move slower than the motor alone.

_3. Build a lego car [50 minutes]_

Allow students to build their lego cars.

_4. Race your car! [10 minutes]_

Allow students to race their classmates’ lego cars.

Give points to the slowest design as well as the most creative design.


#### Discussion Questions:


1. Why did the winning car go the slowest?

2. How did gear ratios affect the speed of the car?
