## Design From a Hat


#### Introduction:


Students will need to use creativity to design a product.


#### Objectives:


Students will learn about iterative design processes and design careers.


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Markers

	
  * Paper




#### Handouts and Other Media:


Print out several pictures of everyday objects (ie from clipart or the internet).  You will need at least 2 unique pictures for each team of students.


#### Preparation Time:


Approximately 15 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Print and cut out cards of different objects.


#### Project Time:


1 hour 30 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. What is a designer? [5 minutes] _Begin by discussing with students what people can design.



	
  * Interiors

	
  * Landscape

	
  * Urban design

	
  * Furniture

	
  * Graphics

	
  * Packaging

	
  * Web

	
  * Fashion

	
  * Jewelry

	
  * Games

	
  * Costumes

	
  * Lighting

	
  * Architecture




Make sure students understand that most engineers are also designers!





2. What is product design_? [10 minutes] _Discuss different products that have been designed relatively recently such as the Snuggie or the iPhone.  Discuss the process that designers might have used to invent these products:



	
  1. Observe real life

	
  2. Define a “problem”

	
  3. Generate lots of product ideas to solve the problem

	
  4. Refine your ideas to a final version





_3. Design a product [1 hour 15 minutes]_ Put students into teams of 2 or 3.  Have each team draw two product cards at random.  The students challenge is to design ONE product that incorporates both products on their cards.  Students should brainstorm and sketch as least 3 design options and then choose their favorite to make a final product sketch.  Our students ended up designing products that incorporated pairs of unlike products such as chairs and locks, watering cans and gift boxes, etc.  They used their creativity and came up with some amazing ideas!

## Logo Logistics







#### Introduction:


Students learn about how designers represent their products.


#### Objectives:


Students will learn how to brainstorm product names, sketch logos, and will learn how to use a graphics editor on their computer.  Students’ designs will be used to make a stamp with their final logo design.


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * computers




#### Handouts and Other Media:


[name brainstorming](http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/name-brainstorming.docx)


#### Preparation Time:


25 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:





	
  * Print name brainstorming worksheet.

	
  * Make a presentation with different famous logos and examples of how different fonts changes the message of certain words.

	
  * Download [Inkscape](http://9-dots.org/bagulators-spyhats-and-shredpacks-oh-my/www.inkscape.org) onto students’ computers.




#### Project Time:


1 hour 30 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. What are ways to think of product names? [10 minutes]_


Discuss with students various ways that products are commonly named, including:








	
  * Brainstorm adjectives

	
  * Add a prefix or a suffix (ie iPhone)

	
  * Create a compound word (ie TurboTax)

	
  * Make up a word (ie Doritos)

	
  * Change spelling (ie Trix)

	
  * Use a verb (ie Swiffer, shuffle)




2. _How do different fonts change the meaning of a word? [10 minutes]_










An important part of representing a product name is the font.  Show students the same word, ie “Thank you,” with various fonts, and have students shout out what different meanings the fonts evoke.





3. _What are logos? [10 minutes] _Discuss what a logo is and its purpose.  Show students famous logos to see if they recognize what the logo represents:



	
  * NBC

	
  * Apple

	
  * Nike

	
  * World Cup


_4. Name brainstorming [30 minutes]_ Have students work through the name brainstorming worksheet for the product that they created during Project 1 – “Design from a Hat”.

_5. Logo design [30 minutes]_ Have students design their logo using[Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/), paying attention to the font they use to write their product name. We took the logos our students designed to a local fabrication shop called [The Build Shop](http://www.thebuildshop.org/)that has a laser cutter, and laser-cut rubber stamps from the students’ logo designs.  In order to do this, our students needed to set their document properties to 1.25″x1.00″, and their designs needed to be in black and white only. It also helps to use Adobe Illustrator to compile all the logo designs in one vector file.

_Thanks to [sparktruck](http://sparktruck.org/curriculum) for the inspiration to add a laser-cut stamp component to this project!_

## Colors and Patterns




#### Introduction:


Students will think about how products use colors and patterns.


#### Objectives:


Students will investigate product colors and patterns in real life, and use what they learned to think about the colors and patterns of their own products.


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Computer




#### Handouts and Other Media:





	
  * __[Colors and Patterns Investigation](http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Colors-and-Patterns.docx)__

	
  * __[Colors and patterns of final design](http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/final-design_color-pattern.docx)__




#### Preparation Time:


_Approximately 10 minutes_


#### Preparation Tasks:


_Print and distribute handouts._


#### Project Time:


_1 hour 10 minutes_


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


__1. How are colors and patterns used in products? [10 minutes]_ _Show students a product (such as a garden hose) in its typical color (ie green) and a non-typical color (ie pink).  Ask students which product is the one they normally see.  Discuss why products are typically certain colors and what happens when a designer uses colors that are not the norm.

2. _Color and pattern investigation [30 minutes]_ Have students work through the “Colors and Patterns Investigation” handout.  The students should search images for the products on the list and note whether that product is generally a certain color or pattern.__

3. _Design your product [30 minutes]_ Have students work through the “Colors and Patterns of Final Design” handout.  The students should look up the 2 products they originally drew in the “Design from a Hat” project and note whether those products are typically a certain color or pattern.  The students should use this information to inform what color or pattern they will make their product.  Students should then use a computer program, such as Inkscape, to draw a final image of their product. [back to projects](http://9-dots.org/bagulators-spyhats-and-shredpacks-oh-my/#top)..


## We Can Market That…
