## Toothpick & Gumdrop Bridges




#### Introduction:


Students will learn about basic structural engineering by building a toothpick and gumdrop bridge that can span 8 inches and hold 4 pounds of weight.


#### Objectives:


Students will build upon what they learned in the Retrofitting for Earthquakes project.  They will learn which shapes are stronger, squares or triangles.

#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * 100 toothpicks per team

	
  * 50 gumdrops or spice drops per team




#### Handouts and Other Media:


Video of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse: [http://archive.org/details/SF121](http://archive.org/details/SF121)


#### Preparation Time:


Approximately 15 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Divide project materials  for each team.


#### Project Time:


1 hour 15 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. Tacoma Narrows Bridge Video [10 minutes] _Show the video, and then ask the students why they think the bridge might have collapsed.  Explain the reasons (narrowness of bridge, lightness, wind resistance, vibrations, etc.) and ask the students to brainstorm how they could build their bridge to avoid those problems.

2. _Building the Bridge [45 minutes – 1 hour] _Students will build their toothpick and gumdrop bridges in teams.  Bridges must span at 8 inches and be at least 10 inches long.  Up to 4 pounds of weight will be placed on top of the bridges; the bridge that can hold the most weight wins!

3. _Testing [2 minutes per group] _We used water bottles and metal locks as weights, and bridges were placed on two desks placed 8 inches apart.  Students should be asked to think about what makes some teams’ bridges so much stronger than others.
