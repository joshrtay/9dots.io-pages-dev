#### Unit Overview:


Students will learn about simple machines and particularly about cranks.  Students will understand how cranks work, why they are useful, find examples of cranks in their everyday lives, and create 2 crank projects.


#### Grade Level:


4-8

#### Projects:


[Paper Crank Toy](http://9-dots.org/crank-it-up#paper) - Introduce the concepts of a simple machine and create a simple crank toy from paper.

[Wire Crank Toy: Part 1](http://9-dots.org/crank-it-up#wire1) - Students will learn how cranks can change the direction of a force by designing a wire crank toy.

[Wire Crank Toy: Part 2](http://9-dots.org/crank-it-up#wire2) - Students will use their designs and knowledge of cranks to construct their wire crank toy.

## Intro and a paper crank toy




#### Introduction:


Introduction project provides an introduction to the unit and provides a fun, easy deliverable.


#### Objectives:


During Project #1, students will learn about what simple machines are and how cranks work.  Students will identify cranks in their everyday life and make a simple crank deliverable.


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Construction paper

	
  * Straws

	
  * Markers

	
  * Tape

	
  * Corrugated cardboard

	
  * Single hole punch




#### Handouts and Other Media:


A video of the project can be found [**here**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtTCUv2_0yE).


#### Preparation Time:


Approx 20 min


#### Preparation Tasks:


Make an example paper crank toy.  Download youtube video and set up the projector.


#### Project Time:


1 hour 20 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. What is a machine?_

Start with the students in a large group.  Discuss with students what they think a simple machine is.  Slowly lead the students to this definition of a simple machine: A simple machine is something that changes the _direction _or_magnitude_ of a force.

Give examples of machines, and discuss how they change the magnitude or direction of a force:



	
  * see saw

	
  * ramp

	
  * pliers

	
  * pulleys

	
  * bicycle


2. _What is a crank?_

Discuss with students what they think a crank is.  A crank is a type of machine.  It is something connected to an axle that rotates in a circular motion.  When force is applied to the crank, it allows the axel to do work.

Brainstorm examples of cranks students have used in their everyday lives:



	
  * Pencil sharpener

	
  * Fishing reel

	
  * Manual car window

	
  * Bicycle


_3. Build a simple crank toy_

Show the students the video of the crank toy.  Walk students through the steps to make the toy.



	
  * use one piece of cardboard and roll it into a tube, tape it

	
  * use a sharp pencil punch to punch one hole on either side of your tube

	
  * cut a shape from the cardboard (students can experiment with different shapes)

	
  * hole punch the cardboard shape

	
  * push your straw half way through your tube, stick on the egg shape, and then push the straw the rest of the way through

	
  * take another piece of paper and roll it around the inside of your tube to make it the right size, tape it

	
  * Trace the bottom circle on a new piece of paper, cut out the circle.

	
  * attach the circle and your inner tube by cutting tabs on the bottom of the inner tube and folding over the circle shape.  tape together if needed.

	
  * finally, attach your creature to the inner tube and your done!


Distribute materials and have students build their crank toy.


#### Discussion Questions:


1. How does the crank toy work?

2. In what motion do you apply force to the crank toy?

3. In what motion does the crank toy move?

4. Is this toy a simple machine?  Why?

## Wire Crank Toy – Part 1




#### Introduction:


![](http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_0451-150x150.jpg)

Students will design and begin to build a wire crank toy.


#### Objectives:


Students will learn how cranks can change the direction of a force by designing a wire crank toy.




#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Craft wire – 12 gauge.  About 4 ft per student.

	
  * Heat shrink

	
  * Pony beads

	
  * Wood scraps

	
  * 1/2 inch philips head wood screws

	
  * pliers

	
  * wire cutters

	
  * screw driver




#### Handouts and Other Media:


_[wire crank toy handout](http://9dotscommunity.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/wire-crank-toy-handout.pdf)_


#### Preparation Time:


2 hours


#### Preparation Tasks:


Put heat shrink on the end of wire pieces to make them less sharp for the students.  Teacher should also make an example of the project to show students.


#### Project Time:


1 hour


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. Review: What is a machine?_

Review with students what a machine is.  A machine is something that changes the _direction _or _magnitude_ of a force.

Play “Is it a machine?” to review the definition of a simple machine.



	
  * show a mixture of items that are simple machines and not simple machines and have the students vote on what they think it is.


2. _Review: What is a crank?_

Review what a crank is.  A crank is a type of machine.  It is something connected to an axle that rotates in a circular motion.  When force is applied to the crank, it allows the axel to do work.

Review examples of cranks students have used in their everyday lives:



	
  * Pencil sharpener

	
  * Fishing reel

	
  * Manual car window

	
  * Bicycle


_3. Project Overview_

Show students the example wire project and explain that students will be making one of these machines over the next two days.  Have students identify where the crank is on the machine, and how the crank is making the other pieces move.

4_. Project Design_

Students should spend time designing their wire toy with pencil and paper.  Show students example photos and videos and give students handout with choices of elements to include.

Students should have a COMPLETE sketch before they are able to start building.
