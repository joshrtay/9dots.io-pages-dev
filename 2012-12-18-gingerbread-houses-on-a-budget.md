## Our last project of the semester!


Our students had been clamoring to make gingerbread houses for a while. I’m pretty sure they started before Thanksgiving. But as with all 9 Dots projects, we knew we had to add a science, tech, engineering, or math (STEM) twist. We finally decided to give each student a budget of eight dollars for their gingerbread houses. A festive project, plus practice working with decimals sounded perfect for our students!

When we started to introduce the project, several students panicked. One looked through his wallet and said, “..but I don’t have eight dollars. Do I have to miss the project?”

Others thought eight dollars was a bit too much for a gingerbread house. But once we explained that the we were using imaginary money, and that we were assigning all the different supplies (graham crackers, icing, candy, etc.) a money value, they quickly got excited again.

We assigned prices to each item – for example, 75 cents for a graham cracker square or a candy cane, 20 cents for a set of 10 m&m’s (the math on this one tripped a lot of students up) and 25 cents per spice drop. We also bought green, red, and white icing for the kids to decorate their houses.

Unfortunately, cookie icing, the kind made by Wilton and sold in Elmer’s glue-like bottles, is pretty expensive and it’s the only kind of ready-made icing that will hold gingerbread or graham crackers together. So instead, we used a hot glue gun which actually turned out for the best. With icing, you have to wait for everything to set before decorating it, and we just didn’t have the time in one session. With hot glue, all you have to do is wait for the glue to cool down and you’re all set!

Our basic lesson plan is below:


#### Introduction:


Students will review adding/subtracting decimals and making a budget

<!-- more -->


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Several types of candy

	
  * Graham crackers – or you could use real gingerbread

	
  * Icing (For decoration)

	
  * Paper plates (to hold the gingerbread houses)

	
  * Hot glue gun & glue sticks




#### Handouts and Other Media:


Paper with space for a budget


#### Preparation Time:


Approximately 15 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Set out project materials at front of room.


#### Project Time:


45 – 65 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


1. _Making a Budget [25 minutes] _Explain to the students that they each have eight dollars of imaginary money to spend to make a gingerbread house. Show them the budget handout and explain that they must list the Item Name, Unit Price, Quantity, and Total Price for each type of ingredient they purchase. There may be questions about what words like “quantity” and “item” mean. Explain that the total amount must equal eight dollars or less, and that an adult must check each budget before the student can go pick up their supplies.

2.  _Making the houses [20-40 minutes] _Once students gather their supplies, they should go to an adult who can help them hot glue together the graham cracker structure for their house. Afterwards, the student can start decorating. The candy can be stuck on with icing rather than a hot glue gun, though the glue gun works as well.
