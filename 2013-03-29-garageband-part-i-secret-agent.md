## Plus, a song that makes you want to dance, and one that makes you sleepy...


For the first part of our week working with [GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/), students got a brief intro to the software and spent most of class trying out all the tools and effects that they could use in GarageBand.

To first familiarize our students with GarageBand, we had them follow along with an[ introductory GarageBand tutorial on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMuQchbJRG0).  This tutorial goes over how to add loops, real instruments, and your voice, and how to do cool effects with your voice.

The loops used included the "Secret Agent Theme" loops, which were incredibly popular with our students, and we got a lot of laughs when the tutorial touched on how to record your own voice and edit the way it sounds ("Hello, I'm James Bond..." sounds_** very** _different depending how high or low pitched your voice is!)

After completing the tutorial, students split into groups of 2-3 to make two tracks of their own.  One track had to make listeners feel like going to sleep, and the other had to make listeners want to dance!

Unsurprisingly, several students asked about how to make dubstep in GarageBand.  Luckily, there are a bunch of tutorials on youtube that can show you how!

#### Our basic lesson plan is below:




#### Introduction:


Students follow along with this [GarageBand tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMuQchbJRG0), then work on two tracks of their own.


#### ![](http://9-dots.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif)Materials:





	
  * computers with GarageBand installed

	
  * **IMPORTANT:** If this is your first time using GarageBand on your computer, you will need to set aside time to install the complete set of instruments and loops.  Otherwise, a lot of the options will be greyed out.  This normally should take 30-45 minutes, but with the Internet in our classroom it took almost 4 hours.




#### Project Time:


90 minutes, but the students would have happily kept on working if we'd had more time.  Allow at least half an hour for the tutorial.
