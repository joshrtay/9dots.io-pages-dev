## Soundtracks, Scores & More!


For the second part of our week working with [GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/), students chose their favorite videoclips from a selection we had on the computers, and set them to music. The videoclips are all free under the Creative Commons License and can be downloaded from the [Beeple channel on vimeo](vimeo.com/channels/beeple) - they have a very cool sci-fi/futuristic look, and we highly recommend them!

But before the students started working on their music, we wanted them to understand how background music can influence the viewer's emotions.  We showed them the same video clip but with five different music scores (after combing through the internet, we'd found a perfect example [here](http://www.midnightmusic.com.au/2011/06/an-intro-to-film-scoring-same-scene-5-ways/)), and asked the students to write down how changing the music made each clip different, and how the clips made them feel.

Each clip got different reactions; some made students feel "like going to sleep", another made students feel like "Indiana Jones on an adventure" or like they were in Egypt, and yet another made students feel "apprehensive" or like "it was Halloween." Halloween, of course, was written in big spooky letters.

The students then got to work picking out their videoclips and composing their film scores in GarageBand!  By uploading their videoclips to iMovie and selecting their song from the "Garageband" music tab in iMovie, they were able to put everything together. Check out the video at the top of this post for one of our favorite examples!

Our basic lesson plan is below:


#### Introduction:


Students learn what film scores and soundtracks are, and discuss the importance of music in videos and films.  Students learn how to integrate their work in GarageBand and iMovie.

![](http://9-dots.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif)Materials:



	
  * computers with GarageBand and iMovie installed

	
  * sample videoclips (optional) - we used these from [Beeple](http://vimeo.com/channels/beeple) on Vimeo

	
  * writing materials for students to write down their thoughts on the videoclip: [An Intro to Film Scoring: One Scene 5 Ways](http://www.midnightmusic.com.au/2011/06/an-intro-to-film-scoring-same-scene-5-ways/)




#### Project Time:


60-90 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


Students first watched the example videoclip, then split into groups of 2-3 to work on their videos.  They chose from the videoclips we had downloaded to the desktop, uploaded their favorites to iMovie, and then put together a score in GarageBand.  To use their music in iMovie, all they had to do was click the tab with music notes on the right side of the screen, and scroll down to find the "GarageBand" tab.

_Note: To be used in iMovie, GarageBand projects need to be saved **with** an iLife preview._
