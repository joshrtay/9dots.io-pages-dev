## Introduction to Density and Egg Float




#### Introduction:


Students will learn what density means, and explore the concept with several different experiments.


#### Objectives:


Students should know what density mean, and understand how density affects everyday materials.


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Food Coloring

	
  * Water

	
  * Oil

	
  * Rubbing Alcohol

	
  * Eggs

	
  * Salt

	
  * Flour

	
  * Tea Bags

	
  * Any other random liquids or insoluble powders for egg float experiment

	
  * Clear plastic cups

	
  * Small plastic cups (~2 inches tall)




#### Handouts and Other Media:





	
  * Pull up pictures of people floating in the Dead Sea




#### Preparation Time:


Approximately 10 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Pour out above materials into cups and distribute to teams.


#### Project Time:


1 hour 15 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. What density? [5 minutes]_

Begin by asking students if they have any ideas about what density means.  Explain that density is an object's weight per unit volume.  We showed the students two small boxes that were the same size: one was filled with cotton balls and the other with a stack of heavy notecards.  We asked the students which was heavier, explaining that although the boxes are the same size, one is much heavier.  Thus, the heavier box is more dense than the lighter box.

We also discussed this introduction to density in terms of brownies.  Do students like their brownies light and fluffy or heavy and dense?

_2. Water, Oil, Rubbing Alcohol Layers_ _[15 minutes]_

Continue this introduction to density with the water, oil, and alcohol layers.  Before pouring the liquids, have the students hypothesize which material they think is most dense.  After pouring, explain that the most dense liquid always sinks to the bottom and the least dense always floats.

_3. Egg Float [15 minutes][![](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/Photo-Feb-12-4-55-37-PM-e1361985690803-225x300.jpg)](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/Photo-Feb-12-4-55-37-PM.jpg)_

Give the students an egg and a cup of water as well as a variety of materials (listed above).  Explain to the students that the challenge is to make the egg float.  (The solution is to make the water so dense with salt that the egg floats to the top).

Once the students have all discovered the solution to the challenge, discuss this phenomena further.  Why did the salt make the egg float but not the other materials? Show students pictures of the dead sea.

_4. Least Dense Mixture [15 minutes]_

Give each student a small plastic cup and challenge them to use the same materials available from the prior challenge to make the least dense mixture.  Students should weigh their concoctions on a scale and track their results on the board.  Once you have a winner, discuss how they achieved the least dense mixture.

_5. Most Dense Mixture [15 minutes]_

Repeat the prior exercise, this time trying to attain the most dense mixture.


#### Discussion Questions:


1. How did you make the egg float in the water?  Why did that work?  Why didn't it work mixing in flour?

## Buoyancy and Boat Making







#### Introduction:


Students will continue exploring density, now adding in the concept of buoyancy as they design their own boats.


#### Objectives:


Students will get hands on experience thinking about electricity and use their creativity to make a variety circuits with the Makey Makey.


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Aluminum foil

	
  * Straws

	
  * Duct tape

	
  * Paper

	
  * Plastic wrap





#### Handouts and Other Media:




#### Preparation Time:


5 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Distribute supplies to teams of students.  Prepare example foil boat for the introduction to buoyancy.


#### Project Time:


1 hour 15 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. Review: What is density? [5 minutes]_

Review the concepts of density learned in the Egg Float project.

_2.  Introduction to buoyancy [10 minutes]_

Prior to the lesson, cut a square piece of aluminum foil and measure its weight on a scale.  Measure out the same weight of water in a small plastic cup.  Crumple your foil into a large, not-dense, boat and show students how the boat floats.  Explain that the boat is floating because it is less dense than the water.  Furthermore, the boat is displacing its own weight in water (show them your small cup of water to show how much water your foil boat is displacing).  Slowly crumple your boat into a smaller and smaller, more dense structure, showing how each time, it sits lower in the water.  Students should use these concepts in today's boat building challenge.

_3. Boat building part 1 [30 minutes][![](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/Photo-Feb-13-4-59-51-PM-e1361985775145-225x300.jpg)](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/Photo-Feb-13-4-59-51-PM.jpg)_

Give each team of students 1 piece of foil, 5 straws, and some duct tape.  The students challenge is to build a boat that can hold the most amount of weight while floating in water.  Once students are finished building, load the boats with weights (we used marbles, padlocks, legos...) to see whose holds the most weight!

_4. Boat building part 2 [30 minutes]_

This challenge can be repeated with new materials.  This time, give the students a piece of paper, a piece of plastic wrap, and 5 straws and have them try out the challenge again!


#### Discussion Questions:


1. Which aluminum boat held the most weight?  Why?  How was it shaped? How were the straws used?  Why did it perform the best?
