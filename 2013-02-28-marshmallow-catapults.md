## Marshmallow Catapults




#### Introduction:


Students will learn about simples machines and the mechanics of catapults in this hands on competition.


#### Objectives:


Students should know what a simple machine is, and how the mechanics of a catapult can make a marshmallow shoot the farthest.


#### Grade Level:


4-8

<!-- more -->


#### Materials and Costs:





	
  * Legos

	
  * Mini Marshmallows

	
  * Plastic Spoons

	
  * Rubber Bands




#### Handouts and Other Media:




#### Preparation Time:


Approximately 5 minutes


#### Preparation Tasks:


Write the different kinds of simple machines on the board.  Tape a "starting line" on the floor for the catapult competition.


#### Project Time:


1 hour 30 minutes


#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:


_1. What are simple machines? [10 minutes]_

Start with the students in a large group.  Discuss with students what they think a simple machine is.  Slowly lead the students to this definition of a simple machine: A simple machine is something that changes the _direction _or _magnitude_ of a force.

Give examples of machines, and discuss how they change the magnitude or direction of a force:



	
  * see saw

	
  * ramp

	
  * pliers

	
  * pulleys

	
  * bicycle




Explain that there are six basic types of simple machines: lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, wedge, and screw.





_2. How do catapults work? [10 minutes]_

What simple machine is used in catapults and trebuchets? Catapults and trebuchets use a lever to do work. Have students explain how a catapult is changing the magnitude or direction of the force that you put into it.



_3. Marshmallow Catapult Competition [1 hour 10 minutes]_


#### Discussion Questions:


1. Which catapult threw the marshmallow the farthest?  Why?
